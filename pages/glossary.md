Hanger-90: If an opposing team’s rolling quarters exits the middle through a receiver’s Pillars, that receiver is entitled to catch the rolling quarter. If they succeed ( “hanger-90”) the receiver’s team gains 2 points. The team who rolled this hanger-90 must let the team attempt to catch the quarter before retrieving their quarter. There is no penalty but they have violated the etiquette of the game and should feel shame.  

Free-90: This is the combination of a hanger-90 and no-hander lander. A Free-90 also begets a rare opportunity — the game stops and the receiver of the Free-90 is granted one chance to catch a “No Hander Lander” thrown by their partners. If they compete successfully, that team immediately wins the game and their next game.
