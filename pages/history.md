# History of the Game:  

Fork Quarters was developed in 2013? By Grant Buckingham, Killian Burns, Little Alex, and Jordan “Jo’j” Mirocha . Killian was showing everyone a mini game Get Forked which was on the “Minute to win it” TV game show. Grant though that was STUPID and boring to watch. Then one person started moving the fork to try and catch the rolling quarter. The other two people started doing the same thing on the same table in a cross fire action. This was fun but it needed more structure. There were four pint glasses on the table so we used them as markers, pillars as they are now known, in the center of the table. We created a square and started using this square to develop rules. We played for hours that first night, it was something special.
